## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r reading data, echo=FALSE}
data = read.csv("/Users/pranavpalli/Desktop/summer_21/data/deseq_results/analysis_results/wt_wr1.csv", header = TRUE, row.names = 1)
data = as.data.frame(data)

View(data)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r sorting data, echo=FALSE}
data = data[data$sig == "FDR < 0.05",]
data = data[complete.cases(data), ]

write.csv(data, "/Users/pranavpalli/Desktop/summer_21/data/deseq_results/analysis_results/hm.csv")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
